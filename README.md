## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- ARIA Accessible
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Css library
- [just-valid](https://github.com/just-valid/just-valid) - Lightweight JavaScript form validation library

### What I learned

I learned how to build responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, implement accessible form validation, and enhance user experience with keyboard navigation and screen reader support. I also gained experience using Tailwind CSS for styling and just-valid for lightweight form validation.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) – Helped me understand how to use responsive utility classes and how to apply spacing, typography, and custom colors effectively.

- [just-valid Documentation](https://just-validate.dev/docs/intro) – It offers comprehensive guides, API references, and practical examples for integrating form validation, customizing validation rules, and managing error messages in web forms.
